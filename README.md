# Working With Me

Hi, I'm Jason!

I'm excited to be working with you and consider this a convenient way to share my management style, philosophy, and expectations as we work together at [Anvyl](https://anvyl.com). I look forward to doing amazing things with you and the rest of the team.

This is a living document, which will change. Please let me know if you have any feedback on how to make this more useful.

## My Job

I am primarily here to do 2 things:

* To provide context
* To engage, retain, and grow amazing talent (that's you!)

I'm here to help, empower and support you, to set context for what you're working on, and to advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company.

## Leadership Style

I'm a believer in [Servant Leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership). I serve you, not the other way around. I'm always available to assist. Ask me.

You work for the company, not for me. Optimize for the company. I'm making mistakes, and I want to improve just like you. Hold me accountable. Tell me. I view our working relationship as an alliance.

## My Availability

You are always welcome and encouraged to drop a meeting on my calendar (you don't need to ask first). Just schedule an event on Google Calendar or through my Calendly [link](https://calendly.com/jason-287/30min).

If you want or need to talk to me, and my schedule is not open, DM me on Slack and I'll make time.

## Process and Software Engineering

People build software and products, not the other way around. As such, I prefer to adjust process to meet the needs and goals of our people. This frees us to do our best work for the company we work for. 

* I value transparency about what happened, what's happening, and what's going to happen.
* I value growth and learning. Experiment with clear goals and tight feedback loops. Share your learnings with others.
* I value your time and will do my best to ensure it is not wasted. I expect the same from you.
* I value proactivity and self-organization. I don't make all the decisions. I'm sure you don't want me to either.
* I value stability and consistency.
* I value critical thinking and rigor. We don't do anything *"because we've always done it that way"*.
* I value intentionality, we have too much to do for any of it to be random.
* I value empathy. Having empathy for your co-workers will help us to build strong teams.

## Transparency

I will work to be as open as possible about what's going on with our team and the company. You can ask me anything. The vast majority of the time I'll answer. Very infrequently, I won't be able to. But I'm committed to never lying to you.

## Feedback

More than anything, candid and compassionate feedback is central to a cohesive high-functioning team. I fully embrace [radical candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) and encourage you to take [courage over comfort](https://brenebrown.com/blog/2018/03/13/courage-comfort-rumbling-shame-accountability-failure-work/).

I prefer to receive direct feedback. I'm committed to providing you clear and timely feedback, and wish you do the same for me. 

Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:

* Safety (unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback)
* Effort (the amount of work in order to give feedback)
* Benefit (likelihood that giving you feedback will materially impact your behavior)

Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions.

## 1:1 Meetings

These meetings are for you and the agenda is what you make it. What is it you'd like to talk to me about? What's exciting you? What's frustrating you? What could I do today that would make you happier or more productive? We don't need to talk about project status in this meeting, unless you want to. I'll ask questions and provide feedback along the way, but this is your time.

The length, frequency, and medium are also up to you, but my hope is that we'll have at least 30 minutes each other week. This is only a minimum though, and not a maximum. 

## Work/Life Balance.

I value work/life balance in my own life and yours. When we first meet at Anvyl, we'll establish what we call *dark times*, which are blocks of time that free you from the busyness of work. Though I need to continually get better at this, I will try not to respond to e-mails or Slack during off-hours and under no circumstances expect you to, unless it's an emergency.
