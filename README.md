# Working With Me

Hi, I'm Jason!

I'm excited to be working with you and consider this a convenient way to share my management style, philosophy, and expectations as we work together at [Anvyl](https://anvyl.com). I look forward to doing amazing things with you and the rest of the team.

This is a living document, which will change. Please let me know if you have any feedback on how to make this more useful.

## My Job

I'm here to do 2 things:

* To provide context
* To engage, retain, and grow an amazing team

I'm here to set context for what you're working on as well as to advocate for you to rest of the company.

## Leadership Style

I'm a believer in [Servant Leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership). I serve you, not the other way around. I'm always available to assist. Please ask me anything.

You work for the company, not for me. Optimize for the company. I'll be making mistakes, so I want to continuously improve. Please hold me accountable. Our relationship is an alliance.

## My Availability

You are always welcome and encouraged to drop a meeting on my calendar (you don't need to ask first). Just schedule an event on Google Calendar or through my Calendly [link](https://calendly.com/jason-287/30min).

If you want or need to talk to me, and my schedule is not open, DM me on Slack and I'll make time.

## Process and Software Engineering

People build software and products. Therefore, we are always seeking to continuously improve process to meet the needs and goals of our people. This frees us to do our best work.

* We experiment with clear goals, tight feedback loops, and share our learnings with others.
* We value proactivity and self-organization.
* We value critical thinking and rigor. We don't do anything *"because we've always done it that way"*.

## Transparency

I will work to be as open as possible about what's going on with our team and the company. You can ask me anything. The vast majority of the time I'll answer. Very infrequently, I won't be able to. But I'm committed to never lying to you.

## Feedback

I fully embrace [radical candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) and encourage you to take [courage over comfort](https://brenebrown.com/blog/2018/03/13/courage-comfort-rumbling-shame-accountability-failure-work/).

I prefer direct feedback. I'm committed to providing you clear and timely feedback, and wish you to do the same for me. 

## 1:1 Meetings

These meetings are for you and the agenda is what you make it. What is it you'd like to talk to me about? What's exciting you? What's frustrating you? What could I do today that would make you happier or more productive? We don't need to talk about project status in this meeting, unless you want to. I'll ask questions and provide feedback along the way, but this is your time.

The length, frequency, and medium are also up to you, but my hope is that we'll have at least 30 minutes each other week. This is only a minimum though, and not a maximum. 

## Work/Life Balance.

I value work/life balance in my own life and yours. When we first meet at Anvyl, we'll establish what we call *dark times*, which are blocks of time that free you from the busyness of work. Though I need to continually get better at this, I will try not to respond to e-mails or Slack during off-hours and under no circumstances expect you to, unless it's an emergency.
